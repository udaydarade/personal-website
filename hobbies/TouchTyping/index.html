        So , When I had started coding I was very slow because of my typing skills, and I had to actually use some of my brain power while typing.
        <div>Then I got to know about touch typing and started to learn it.</div>
        <div>Initially it took about 10 days to get to speed of 40 wpm and then in just 10 more days i got to 60 wpm .</div>
        <div>After 60 wpm I was satisfied and then I thought that its enough but I got another Idea</div>
        <div><span>Why not make lectures notes on laptop by typing .</span> And my next goal was to get 80 wpm which i achieved in about 10 days</div>
        <div>As of now I am at 100wpm</div>
        <div>
            The websites I used for typing are 
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://10ff.net/login">10 fast fingers</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://monkeytype.com/">Monkey type</a></li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        </main>
